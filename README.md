# Snowflake + Power BI End-to-End Analytics — Tasty Bytes Project

This repository contains my full **end-to-end analytics project** built on top of the **Tasty Bytes** dataset available in Snowflake Marketplace.  
It demonstrates how I take raw marketplace data → model it → build a clean dimensional schema → and create insights using Power BI.

This project is structured exactly the way a real analytics/BI team would approach data modeling and dashboard development.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### **Objective**
Build an end-to-end analytics solution using:

- **Snowflake**  
- **Snowflake Marketplace**  
- **Dynamic Tables**  
- **Power BI**  

This project focuses on:

- Data profiling and quality checks  
- Creating a full **star schema** (dimensions + fact tables)  
- Using **dynamic tables** as a lightweight, CDC-friendly transformation layer  
- Exposing the curated dataset to Power BI  
- Producing insights using clean BI modeling  

---

## 🧱 Key Components

### 🔹 1. **Snowflake SQL & Data Engineering**
Located in the `/sql` folder.

Includes:

- Marketplace data setup  
- Data profiling  
- Dimensional modeling (surrogate keys, conformed dimensions)  
- Fact table creation  
- Data governance and schema/role setup  

These scripts collectively build:

- `DT_DIM_*` tables (Customers, Trucks, Locations, Dates, Times, Menu Items, Franchise)  
- `DT_FACT_ORDER_DETAIL`
- `DT_FACT_ORDER_HEADER`
- **`DT_FACT_ORDER_AGG`** – main analytics fact table  

---

### 🔹 2. **Dimensional Model Documentation**
Located in `/data-model/fact_and_dimensions.md`.

Contains:

- Grain definitions  
- Surrogate keys  
- Business attributes  
- Fact vs dimension logic  
- Complete star schema explanation  
- Model diagrams  

---

### 🔹 3. **ETL / Pipeline Logic**
Located in `/pipelines/etl_pipeline.md`.

Covers:

- How raw marketplace tables are mapped to dynamic tables  
- Refresh flow using Snowflake’s `TARGET_LAG`  
- Dependency graph & lineage  
- Warehouse assignments  
- Performance considerations  

---

### 🔹 4. **Power BI Dashboards & Insights**
Located in `/dashboards/insights.md`.

Includes:

- Screenshots of visuals  
- Regions → City performance analysis  
- KPI metrics using the aggregated fact table  
- Interpretation of insights  
- How data modeling enables faster reporting  

---

### 🔹 5. **Visual Assets**  
Located in `/assets`.

Contains:

- Architecture diagrams  
- Lineage screenshots  
- Power BI model views  
- SQL exploration screenshots  

These are also embedded into GitHub Pages for easier presentation.
